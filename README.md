## Objective


You have recently joined the Cymbal Bank as a junior cloud security analyst where you work alongside a team of dedicated security professionals to secure the organization's data, applications, and systems. After completing a thorough assessment of its existing on-premises infrastructure, Cymbal Bank has finalized its planned migration to a hybrid cloud environment. Part of the plan involves extending its on-premises data center infrastructure to connect into Google Cloud. The new cloud network infrastructure has been successfully architected and is ready to be deployed. Before it can be deployed, the security team wants to explore assessing the security of the new cloud network infrastructure. Your team lead, Chloe, has assigned you the task of conducting research to explore the security of the configuration settings of the new cloud network setup. In order to do this, you'll need to perform your testing on a new test environment that replicates the newly architected cloud network. You'll begin by using Cloud Shell to create a test VPC and subnets.
### Skills Learned

Cloud Networking (VPC, subnets, routing)

Command-Line Interface (CLI) (Google Cloud SDK, AWS CLI)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (automation via commands/scripts)

Linux & Shell Scripting (basic scripting for automation)

Security & Access Management (IAM roles, firewall rules)

Networking Basics (CIDR blocks, IP addressing, NAT, VPNs)


### Tools Used

Cloud Shell

## Steps

Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you’ll create a network. Next, you’ll create a subnet within the network. Then, you’ll view the created networks. Finally, you’ll list all subnets created within the networks.
